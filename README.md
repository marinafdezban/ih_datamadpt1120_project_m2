## **Introduction:**

The project consisted of analyzing the data obtained from Kaggle. First, clean the data if necessary and then perform an exploratory data analysis in order to understand possible relationships between the features provided and make some insights based on this. Finally, develop an analytical dashboard that facilitates the search for the average price of a diamond according to the desired characteristics.
